# Settings Module Implementation

## Overview

The Settings module provides a centralized area for clients to configure all essential business information, connect integrations, and manage settings for each active module in the Upzento CRM platform. This document outlines the implementation details of the Settings module.

## Database Schema

The Settings module consists of the following database models:

1. **GeneralSettings**: Stores basic business information like company name, logo, contact details, and preferences.
2. **IntegrationSettings**: Manages third-party integrations such as Google Calendar, Twilio, payment gateways, etc.
3. **ModuleSettings**: Stores configuration settings for each module (Appointments, Forms, etc.).
4. **NotificationSettings**: Manages user notification preferences for each module.
5. **SecuritySettings**: Handles security-related settings like password policies and MFA.
6. **AuditLog**: Tracks all changes made to settings for compliance and security purposes.

## Frontend Components

The Settings module includes the following frontend components:

1. **Main Settings Page**: A tabbed interface for accessing different settings categories
2. **General Settings**: Form for managing business information and preferences
3. **Integrations Settings**: Interface for connecting and managing third-party integrations
4. **Module Settings**: Controls for enabling/disabling and configuring each module
5. **User Management**: Interface for managing users and their permissions
6. **Security Settings**: Controls for security and privacy settings
7. **Audit Logs**: Interface for viewing system activity and changes

## Security Considerations

- All settings endpoints require authentication and appropriate authorization
- Sensitive information like API keys and secrets are handled securely
- Changes to critical settings are logged in the audit trail
- Role-based access controls ensure users can only access appropriate settings

## Multi-tenant Considerations

- Each client has their own isolated settings
- Settings are scoped to the client's tenant context
- Agency users can access their clients' settings when impersonating them

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Settings Management**: Allow agencies to apply settings across multiple clients
2. **Settings Templates**: Create reusable templates for quick client setup
3. **Settings Import/Export**: Enable importing and exporting settings between environments
4. **Advanced Security Controls**: Add more granular security options like IP restrictions
5. **Scheduled Settings Changes**: Allow scheduling settings changes for future dates
