# Payment System Implementation

## Overview

The Payment System module provides comprehensive functionality for managing subscriptions, invoices, payments, and payment methods within the Upzento CRM platform. It enables clients to view their upcoming payments and payment history, agencies to manage payments for their clients, and administrators to oversee all platform payments.

## Database Schema

The Payment System module consists of the following database models:

1. **Plan**: Defines subscription plans with pricing, features, and limits
2. **Subscription**: Links clients or agencies to plans with status and renewal information
3. **Invoice**: Represents billing documents with amounts, due dates, and payment status
4. **Payment**: Records individual payments made against invoices
5. **PaymentMethod**: Stores payment method information for clients and agencies

## Frontend Components

The Payment System module includes the following frontend components:

1. **Main Payment Page**: A tabbed interface for accessing different payment features
2. **Subscriptions Tab**: View and manage subscription plans and billing cycles
3. **Invoices Tab**: View and manage invoices and payments
4. **Payment Methods Tab**: Manage payment methods and billing information
5. **Payment Summary Tab**: View payment history and financial summaries

## Multi-tenant Considerations

- Each client and agency has their own isolated payment data
- Clients can only view and manage their own payment information
- Agencies can manage payments for their clients
- Admins can oversee all payments across the platform
- All endpoints enforce proper tenant context for security

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access controls for all payment operations
- Sensitive payment information is handled securely
- PCI compliance for payment processing
- Audit logging for critical payment actions

## Payment Processing Flow

1. **Subscription Creation**: Admin or agency creates a subscription for a client
2. **Invoice Generation**: System or admin generates invoices based on subscription billing cycles
3. **Payment Notification**: Client receives notification of upcoming or due payments
4. **Payment Processing**: Client makes payment using a saved payment method or new payment information
5. **Payment Recording**: System records payment and updates invoice status
6. **Receipt Generation**: System generates receipt for completed payment

## Integration Points

1. **External Payment Gateways**: Integration with Stripe, PayPal, etc. for payment processing
2. **Notification System**: Automated notifications for payment events
3. **Agency/Admin Dashboards**: Payment analytics and reporting

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Billing**: Scheduled invoice generation and payment processing
2. **Payment Plans**: Support for installment payments and payment plans
3. **Discounts and Promotions**: Support for promotional pricing and discounts
4. **Tax Calculation**: Automated tax calculation based on location
