# Client Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
The Client Dashboard is the third tier in our multi-tenant CRM platform, designed for end-clients of agencies. This dashboard provides clients with access to their specific modules, data, and settings in a user-friendly interface that maintains our cosmic/space theme and supports both dark and light modes.

## Architecture
- **Route Structure**: `/client/*` routes for all client-specific pages
- **Layout**: Consistent sidebar navigation with mobile responsiveness
- **Authentication**: Protected routes requiring client-level authentication
- **Data Access**: Limited to client's own data with proper isolation

## Core Components

### Main Dashboard (`/client/page.tsx`)
- Overview statistics for key metrics (forms, appointments, messages, etc.)
- Recent activity timeline
- Upcoming events calendar
- Module performance metrics
- Tab-based navigation for different dashboard views

### Forms Management (`/client/forms/page.tsx`)
- List of all client forms with filtering and search
- Form submissions tracking and management
- Form embedding options with domain restrictions
- Form analytics and performance metrics

### Settings (`/client/settings/page.tsx`)
- General account settings and preferences
- Domain management for widget embedding
- Notification preferences
- Team member management with role-based permissions
- Third-party integrations management

## Planned Modules
The following modules are planned for implementation in the Client Dashboard:

1. **Reviews Management**
   - Collect and display customer reviews
   - Review moderation and response tools
   - Review widgets for embedding

2. **Chat**
   - Web chat and WhatsApp integration
   - Conversation management
   - Chat widget embedding

3. **Phone & SMS**
   - Call tracking and management
   - SMS campaign tools
   - Conversation history

4. **Appointments**
   - Calendar management
   - Service booking
   - Staff scheduling

5. **Shop**
   - Product management
   - Order processing
   - E-commerce analytics

## Data Flow
- Client data is isolated from other clients
- Agency owners can access their clients' dashboards via impersonation
- All embeddable widgets verify domain authorization

## Security Measures
- Role-based access control for client team members
- Domain verification for widget embedding
- Audit logs for sensitive actions
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication

## UI/UX Considerations
- Consistent cosmic/space theme throughout
- Dark and light mode support
- Mobile-responsive design
- Intuitive navigation and information hierarchy
- Accessible interface following best practices

## Next Steps
1. Complete implementation of remaining module pages
2. Integrate with backend APIs for real data
3. Implement client-specific analytics dashboards
4. Add support for white-labeling by agencies
5. Develop comprehensive testing suite
