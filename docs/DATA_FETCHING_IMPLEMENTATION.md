# Data Fetching Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of data fetching for the client panel pages, focusing on three key areas:
1. Analytics
2. Payment
3. Settings

## Architecture

### API Clients
We've implemented strongly-typed API clients for each module:

1. **Base API Client**
   - Located at `frontend/src/lib/api/api-client.ts`
   - Provides authentication, token refresh, and error handling
   - Creates a unified Axios instance with common configuration

2. **Module-Specific API Clients**
   - `analyticsApi`: Handles all analytics-related data
   - `paymentApi`: Manages payment, transactions, and invoicing data
   - `settingsApi`: Controls settings, integrations, and audit logs

3. **TypeScript Interfaces**
   - Each API client defines comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
   - Ensures type safety throughout the application
   - Documents the shape of API responses

### React Hooks
Custom React hooks have been created to simplify data fetching in components:

1. **useAnalytics**
   - Fetches KPI data, traffic metrics, conversion data, etc.
   - Handles date range filtering
   - Provides loading/error states

2. **usePayment**
   - Retrieves transactions, payment methods, invoices
   - Handles pagination and filtering
   - Includes functions for adding/editing payment methods

3. **useSettings**
   - Manages general settings, domain settings, notifications, etc.
   - Provides access to integrations and audit logs
   - Includes update functions for all settings types

## Implementation Details

### Analytics Implementation
- Created comprehensive API client with TypeScript interfaces
- Implemented loading, error, and data states
- Added date range filtering functionality
- Connected API data to dashboard metrics and charts

### Payment Implementation
- Implemented transaction history and payment methods fetching
- Added pagination and filtering
- Integrated real-time data with the payment dashboard
- Provided mutation functions for payment method management

### Settings Implementation
- Created detailed settings API with all required endpoints
- Implemented integrations section with proper categorization
- Added audit logs with advanced filtering and pagination
- Connected settings data to UI components

## Error Handling
The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **API Level**
   - Token refresh on 401 errors
   - Automatic redirection to login on authentication failures
   - Detailed error response parsing

2. **React Hook Level**
   - Standardized error state tracking
   - Loading state management
   - Error recovery mechanisms

3. **Component Level**
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Retry functionality
   - Loading indicators

## Performance Optimizations
- Conditional fetching to avoid unnecessary requests
- Pagination to limit data transfer
- Filtering at the API level
- Caching of frequently accessed data
- Request debouncing for search inputs

## Next Steps
1. **Add API Integration Testing**
   - Write integration tests for API clients
   - Test error handling and edge cases

2. **Implement WebSocket Support**
   - Real-time updates for payment transactions
   - Instant notification of settings changes
   - Live audit log updates

3. **Enhance Error Recovery**
   - Implement retry strategies
   - Add offline support
   - Improve error reporting

4. **Add Data Visualization**
   - Enhance analytics charts with real data
   - Add interactive data exploration
   - Implement data export functionality

5. **Complete Client Page Integrations**
   - Apply data fetching pattern to remaining client pages
   - Ensure consistent loading/error states across the application
