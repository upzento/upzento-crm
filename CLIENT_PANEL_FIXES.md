# Client Panel Navigation Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to fix navigation issues in the client panel, including redirection problems to the dashboard routes and missing functionality in the client settings panel.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Client Panel Navigation
- Identified incorrect redirections from client routes to dashboard routes
- Fixed the following pages to stay within the client section:
  - `/client/analytics` - Previously redirected to `/dashboard/analytics`
  - `/client/payment` - Previously redirected to `/dashboard/payment`

### 2. Enhanced Client Settings Page
- Added additional tabs for complete settings functionality:
  - **Security Settings** - Added authentication, password management, and data privacy controls
  - **Audit Logs** - Added comprehensive activity logging with filtering capabilities
  - **Integrations** - Expanded integrations tab with categorized third-party services

### 3. Dashboard Route Handling
- Modified `/dashboard/*` routes to redirect to their equivalent `/client/*` routes
- Updated the dashboard layout to be a simple pass-through to support redirects
- Updated specific dashboard pages to redirect:
  - `/dashboard` → `/client`
  - `/dashboard/settings` → `/client/settings`
  - `/dashboard/analytics` → `/client/analytics`

### 4. Component Structure
- Created new component files:
  - `frontend/src/app/client/settings/components/security-settings.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/app/client/settings/components/audit-logs.tsx`
  - `frontend/src/app/client/settings/components/integrations-settings.tsx`

## Implementation Details
